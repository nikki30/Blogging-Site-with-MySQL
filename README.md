# Blogging-Site-with-MySQL

Welcome to my blogging website where I use Java, JSP and MYSQL to serve a webpage which enables a user to edit, list and preview their posts.

In the edit option, the user types into the textbox in markdown and when preview'd appears as HTML output for the user to read.

The list option lists the posts by the user, along with the time of creation and modification and an option to edit.
