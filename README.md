# Blogging-Site-with-MySQL

Welcome to my blogging website where I use Java, JSP and MYSQL to serve a webpage which enables a user to edit, list and preview their posts.

In the edit option, the user types into the textbox in markdown and when preview'd appears as HTML output for the user to read.
The edit page has 4 options: Save which saves to database and redirects to list page with this new post, Close which does not save to database and redirects to list page, Preview, which shows HTML form of markdown content, and Delete which deletes post from database if present and returns to list page, else works like Close.

The list option lists the posts by the user, along with the time of creation and modification and an option to open or delete the posts. From this page, a New Post can also be created which opens the edit page.
